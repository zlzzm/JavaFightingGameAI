# JavaFightingGameAI

Usage:
Just literally copy and paste all the files (except the Definitions) into a Processing program. I reccomend making different tabs for each file (such as a tab named Input for Input), but that's just my preference. 


Notes:

- The AI is not finished (so just don't run this yet lol)
- The heavy animation is glitched (I'm fixing this currently)
- Feel free to add any other moves that you would like.
